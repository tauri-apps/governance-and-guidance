# Candidate introductions

Candidates for the [2025 Tauri Board elections](README.md).

## Jacob Bolda

I am Jacob Bolda, [@jbolda][github-jbolda]. Over the years, I led or was involved with many prototypes and first implementations of work we rely on today, such as `create-tauri-app`, the CI/CD and our documentation website. The "type" of time that I have been able to give has evolved with the project over the years, and in recent years, I have found my time best offered and valued in advising, managing, and also speaking about the project on my YouTube channel. Bringing folks in and keeping the project approachable will always be a requirement for the continued success of Tauri.

I assisted Robin in organizing and establishing the Tauri Programme about 4.5 years and joined as a Board Director. My efforts in organizing and advocating for improving management efforts began the year prior to that. I intend to continue these efforts to organize and establish the Tauri community in the most inclusive way I am able. A "theme" that we have been striving for is improving transparency of the organization and the onboarding into roles to further push the project forward.

Frontside Software is the consultancy to which I am employed. I work with as a software engineering consulting for large enterprise. My roles find great overlap in the work and needs of Tauri including engineering architecture, planning, and managing and executing large migrations. As a Director of the Board, I will continue to serve the Tauri community with these skills. We will hone our processes and workflows on the foundations we have established to help our domains achieve the best they are able.

# Reserve candidates

## Robin van Boven

Hallo! I'm Robin van Boven ([@Beanow][github-beanow]), a software engineer based in the Netherlands.
Currently I'm a Tauri Board Director who's working at [CrabNebula], an [official partner of Tauri][cn-partnership].

For this election I'd like to apply as a "reserve candidate". Which I totally made up, so let me explain. As reserve I intend **not to run as candidate for this election**. But in case the election results in a major problem, such as not having a minimum of 3 Board Directors, I'd be happy to apply _after the election_ if that can resolve the issue. Though I think it's unlikely and we'll be in good hands.

Basically **I would prefer to help out as part of the working group going forward**. Here's some background as to why.

Around 2021 I first got involved with Tauri all the groundwork had to be laid, which **required a lot of direct involvement** from the Tauri Board. Nowadays this work is largely done and the Board can concentrate on making key decisions, rather than setting up new structures.

CrabNebula also sponsored a great amount of the time I spent to help lay this groundwork. Today I spend less time directly contributing to Tauri and more time on _services for Tauri users_ like [CrabNebula Cloud](https://crabnebula.dev/cloud/) and [Taurify](https://crabnebula.dev/taurify/)'s build infrastructure.

So I believe it would serve the Tauri community better to pass the baton to a new director. My hope is to see directors who are either more directly involved with the community and/or represents an additional company who is invested in Tauri.

That said I still have strong open-source values and believe I've gained a lot of trust with the community for my past work. So if it were necessary, I'd be willing to return to the Tauri Board.
