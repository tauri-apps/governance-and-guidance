# Candidate introductions

Candidates for the [2025 Tauri Board elections](README.md).

## Jacob Bolda

I am Jacob Bolda, [@jbolda][github-jbolda]. Over the years, I led or was involved with many prototypes and first implementations of work we rely on today, such as `create-tauri-app`, the CI/CD and our documentation website. The "type" of time that I have been able to give has evolved with the project over the years, and in recent years, I have found my time best offered and valued in advising, managing, and also speaking about the project on my YouTube channel. Bringing folks in and keeping the project approachable will always be a requirement for the continued success of Tauri.

I assisted Robin in organizing and establishing the Tauri Programme about 4.5 years and joined as a Board Director. My efforts in organizing and advocating for improving management efforts began the year prior to that. I intend to continue these efforts to organize and establish the Tauri community in the most inclusive way I am able. A "theme" that we have been striving for is improving transparency of the organization and the onboarding into roles to further push the project forward.

Frontside Software is the consultancy to which I am employed. I work with as a software engineering consulting for large enterprise. My roles find great overlap in the work and needs of Tauri including engineering architecture, planning, and managing and executing large migrations. As a Director of the Board, I will continue to serve the Tauri community with these skills. We will hone our processes and workflows on the foundations we have established to help our domains achieve the best they are able.
