## More information

_We're hoping to provide clear and complete information. If you have any questions after reading this section, don't hesitate to ask!_

### Available positions

Currently all 7 Director positions are filled. For 5 Directors their term ends this July.
This election determines who is appointed those 5 seats for the next 2 years (a full term).

### Will all seats be filled?

The minimum is 3 Directors. So not all 5 seats have to be filled. Only when there are enough candidates and _at least half_ of the voters indicate they're _for_ appointing a candidate, would a seat be filled.

In other words candidates will not be appointed "by default" to fill as many seats as possible. Only when they have the confidence of voters.

### How does voting work?

Voters can indicate two things with their vote. For every candidate, whether they're for or against that candidate becoming a Board Director. And between the candidates they are for, listing those candidates in order of preference.

Each candidate needs to meet a "confidence threshold", meaning at least 50% of voters have voted _for_ that candidate. If there are more candidates that meet this threshold than seats, a [scoring system] is used to find the candidates that _got the greatest preference_.

### Can someone run for multiple terms?

As per [Tauri's statutes][statutes-governance]:

> Directors are permitted to seek office for multiple terms, however, when running against other candidates the amount of terms they have consecutively served is deducted from the votes cast in their favour. This provides a balance between continuity, equal opportunities and renewal of qualities and competences.

### Reviewing the election

This voting process is new for Tauri. It was the initiative of the current Board to enable the Working Group to vote, realizing there was little time to prepare. So after the election we would like to review whether the election was executed well enough and validate the results.

We're still looking for people who want to join this committee:
