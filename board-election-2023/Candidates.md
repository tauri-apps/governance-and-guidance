# Candidate introductions

Candidates for the [2023 Tauri Board elections](README.md).

### Applying?

If you're applying as a candidate, we'd love to share your introduction with the voting Working Group members. You're welcome to use the existing introductions as reference. There is no mandatory format, so feel free to write in your own style!

That said, here are some points of attention:

- The document will be public.
- Integrity and transparency are important. Consider using your real name and to mention any relevant interests (ex: contracts or employment).
- Not everyone in the Working Group may be aware of what you do. It's worth highlighting even if you've been part of the community.

## Zack Chapple

Hello Tauri team,

My name is [Zack Chapple][linkedin-zack] and I wanted to take this opportunity to express my interest in joining the board of directors for Tauri. 

Over the last 13 years I have been part of numerous technology communities from Java to Angular to Rspack (Rust webpack) as both a consumer but also a contributor. This experience has given me a wide breadth of knowledge for community dynamics and an understanding of the differences between bleeding edge technologies and long established technologies.

With no formal education in software, I started my career in tech as part of a Helpdesk that turned into Java Developer which evolved into Global Architect roles for multiple Fortune 500 companies. Now I am the Chief Revenue Officer for a global staff augmentation and software consulting shop, Valor Software. Over the last three years I have interacted with even more organizations of global scale and I have seen both the good and bad that comes from tech governance. 

When I met Daniel from the Tauri team and learned what the foundation is trying to achieve I felt that strategically and personally this project is of interest to me. The last several months I have been helping ByteDance to bring their Rust based webpack to the Western market and have created several strategic partnerships on their behalf.  I believe with what I understand of Tauri already and the roadmap I could help grow the platform, the adoption, and the overall community by working closely with and across the individual working groups. 

Additionally the influence of being on the board would mean that I would be able to help provide direct perspective based on the organizations we are exposed to and help with prioritization. 

I appreciate the opportunity to be considered for the board position and look forward to any responses or feedback.

Zack

<!-- Opening -->

Hallo! I'm Robin van Boven (@Beanow), a software engineer based in the Netherlands. Currently I'm a Tauri Board Director, employed by CrabNebula, and would love to continue for another term as a Board Director.

<!-- History with / relevance for Tauri -->

About 2½ years ago I helped with establishing the [Tauri Programme][statutes] and joined as a Board Director. Some of the areas I worked on during this term are:

- Created processes and templates for the Board, to follow regulations more easily.
- Made sure we have multiple admins on important services (reducing our [bus factor] risk).
- Proposed and co-authored the ["Domains and Teams" governance model][governance].

<!-- What you bring to the table -->

My strengths and what I would bring to the Board are:

- Passionate about the fairness, openness and resilience of Tauri.
- Regular time dedicated to _doing work_ for the Board.
- A critical opinion based on experience in open source and software teams.

<!-- Future for Tauri; What you're interested in realizing next term. -->

I believe my skills are best used to strengthen what we do internally. Improving the foundations for other contributors to rely on. Some areas I would work on if elected for another term:

- Investing in the new governance model, making sure we use it effectively.
- A campaign to improve transparency on all fronts, including a much more visible Board.
- Make it significantly easier for the Working Group to submit proposals to the Board.

A strong internal focus for me personally. Of course there is more to discuss, so I'd be happy to keep sharing my opinions and support other initiatives.
